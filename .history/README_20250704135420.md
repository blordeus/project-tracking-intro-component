## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for mobile navigation
- CSS animations and transitions

### What I learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice creating complex layouts with CSS Grid and Flexbox. One of the most challenging aspects was creating the background pattern using pure CSS without relying on image assets.

Here's how I approached the custom background pattern:

I also implemented smooth mobile navigation with JavaScript:

```js
const mobileNavToggle = document.querySelector('.mobile-nav-toggle');
const navigationMenu = document.querySelector('.navigation-menu');

mobileNavToggle.addEventListener('click', () => {
  navigationMenu.classList.toggle('active');
  mobileNavToggle.classList.toggle('active');
});
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to continue focusing on:

- Advanced CSS animations and micro-interactions
- Accessibility improvements with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- Performance optimization techniques
- CSS Grid mastery for complex layouts
- Mobile-first responsive design principles

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This helped me understand CSS Grid layout for the main content area.
- [Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - An excellent resource for understanding flexbox properties.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - Great reference for CSS properties and JavaScript methods.
